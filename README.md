#Habitat with Glass

Legacy project but remaining live as an example of how to convert the News feature to work with Glass.Mapper. Please see https://github.com/muso31/Helixbase 

The ORM has been added to the News Feature - you can add the ORM to features if you wish to use a Glass context per feature.
